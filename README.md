# About:
### A small extension that applies tiny enhancements to Steam.
Steam Tiny Enchancements is an **open-source** (licensed under the Apache License 2.0) **browser extension** designed to apply little adjustments to Steam Website.

Steam Tiny Enchancements includes patches that were developed to **simplify lifes** for me and my friends, but now **any user may request feature** and if it is possible to code, we will eventually do it.

The extension is designed to be **minimal**, yet to **stay powerful**. In public releases **all features are disabled by default**, but we provide **decent onboarding experience to help you customize your installation**. Also we don't do any **shady business practices** and we will **never** agree to integrate **any sort of advertisment** into the extension, *unlike some other competitors.*

# Current features:
* Jump to certain page on Steam Community Market page
* Bulk sell any items from your inventory via new simple to use and powerful Inventory page

*While this list seems pretty small, all features are fully-packed and have many other tiny aspects that help you to be more efficient. Also, we are planning to do A LOT in the future.*
